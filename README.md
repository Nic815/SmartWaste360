# SmartWaste360
A Unified Waste Management App

## Overview
SmartWaste360 is an iOS app that brings citizens, municipal workers, and administrators together on one digital platform.  
It helps people report waste problems, schedule pickups, track e-waste, locate bins using Google Maps, and earn rewards for eco-friendly actions.  
The goal is to make waste management transparent, accountable, and motivating.

## Features
- Complaint reporting with photo and location  
- Pickup scheduling for dry, wet, and e-waste  
- Live bin locator using Google Maps SDK  
- Dedicated e-waste collection points  
- Reward system for responsible waste disposal  
- Auto-escalation after 72 hours if issues stay unresolved  
- Firebase backend for sync, login, and notifications  

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Swift (SwiftUI + MVVM)  
- **Backend:** Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Messaging  
- **APIs:** Google Maps SDK for iOS, CoreLocation  
- **Platform:** iOS 17 and later  

## How Itâ€™s Different from Existing Solutions
Most existing apps, like the Swachhata App under Swachh Bharat Mission, only allow complaint reporting.  
SmartWaste360 goes further by offering:
- A unified platform for citizens, workers, and administrators  
- E-waste pickup tracking and mapped collection points  
- A reward system that motivates responsible behavior  
- Auto-escalation for unresolved complaints  
- Live bin locator powered by Google Maps  
- Real-time updates through Firebase  

This mix of engagement, automation, and accountability makes SmartWaste360 more complete than current municipal or private apps.
